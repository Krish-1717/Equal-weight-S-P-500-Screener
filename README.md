Equal-Weight S&P 500 Portfolio Screener
Overview

This Python project creates an equal-weight S&P 500 portfolio screener using the yfinance library. Unlike the traditional S&P 500 index, which is market-cap weighted, this screener assigns equal importance to each stock in the S&P 500. The program calculates how many shares of each stock to buy based on a user-defined portfolio value and exports the results to an Excel spreadsheet with detailed formatting.

Note: This project is currently under development. Additional features, such as enhanced Excel visualizations, sector allocation charts, and performance tracking, are planned for future updates.
